### Insights

#### High Churn Rate: The percentage of customers who left the company is particularly high.

- Nearly 27% of customers churned, reflecting weak customer loyalty.

#### Primary Churn Drivers — Competitive Offers

- Most churners cited better offers from competitors
- Key reasons: better pricing, devices, larger data allowances, and faster download speeds.
  
#### Churn by Age Group

- Seniors (65+) account for 44% of total churn.
- Age 78–88 shows the highest churn rate, though smaller in absolute size.
- Younger groups (19–38) churn less and form the bulk of the customer base, reflecting that databel has managed to retain its largest customers to an extent

#### Service Experience & Sentiment Issues

- Poor interaction with support staff is the second most cited reason for churn.
- 11.3% of churners left due to dissatisfaction with customer service.

### Conclusion

Databel’s high churn rate is primarily driven by unattractive offers compared to competitors and service experience issues. Seniors are particularly vulnerable, and poor customer support interactions amplify dissatisfaction. Without urgent retention strategies, churn will continue to erode revenue and market share.

#### Proactive Churn Prevention
- Deploy predictive churn models that flag customers most likely to churn, based on behavioral indicators such as reduced usage, frequent support calls, or plan downgrades and engage them early with personalized offers and support to prevent churn
